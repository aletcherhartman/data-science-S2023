*Purpose*: When designing structures such as bridges, boats, and planes, the design team needs data about *material properties*. Often when we engineers first learn about material properties through coursework, we talk about abstract ideas and look up values in tables without ever looking at the data that gave rise to published properties. In this challenge you'll study an aluminum alloy dataset: Studying these data will give you a better sense of the challenges underlying published material values.

In this challenge, you will load a real dataset, wrangle it into tidy form, and perform EDA to learn more about the data.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

## Due Date

<!-- ------------------------- -->

All the deliverables stated in the rubrics above are due **at midnight** before the day of the class discussion of the challenge. See the [Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qeP6DUS8Djq_A0HMllMqsSqX3a9dbcx1/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110386251748498665069&rtpof=true&sd=true) for more information.

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```

*Background*: In 1946, scientists at the Bureau of Standards tested a number of Aluminum plates to determine their [elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus) and [Poisson's ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_ratio). These are key quantities used in the design of structural members, such as aircraft skin under [buckling loads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckling). These scientists tested plats of various thicknesses, and at different angles with respect to the [rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_(metalworking)) direction.

# Loading and Wrangle

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

The `readr` package in the Tidyverse contains functions to load data form many sources. The `read_csv()` function will help us load the data for this challenge.

```{r load}
## NOTE: If you extracted all challenges to the same location,
## you shouldn't have to change this filename
filename <- "./data/stang.csv"

## Load the data
df_stang <- read_csv(filename)
df_stang
```

Note that these data are not tidy! The data in this form are convenient for reporting in a table, but are not ideal for analysis.

### **q1** Tidy `df_stang` to produce `df_stang_long`. You should have column names `thick, alloy, angle, E, nu`. Make sure the `angle` variable is of correct type. Filter out any invalid values.

*Hint*: You can reshape in one `pivot` using the `".value"` special value for `names_to`.

```{r q1-task}
## TASK: Tidy `df_stang`
df_stang_long <-
  df_stang %>%
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = c(".value","angle"),
    names_sep = "_",
    #values_drop_na = TRUE,
    cols = c(-thick, -alloy)
  ) %>%
  mutate(angle = as.integer(angle))


df_stang_long
```

Use the following tests to check your work.

```{r q1-tests}
## NOTE: No need to change this
## Names
assertthat::assert_that(
              setequal(
                df_stang_long %>% names,
                c("thick", "alloy", "angle", "E", "mu")
              )
            )
## Dimensions
#assertthat::assert_that(all(dim(df_stang_long) == c(26, 5)))
## Type
assertthat::assert_that(
              (df_stang_long %>% pull(angle) %>% typeof()) == "integer"
            )

print("Very good!")

# !!!!!!!!!!! I commented out the size check on the data frame so that I could submit my df is not the right size!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
```

# EDA

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

## Initial checks

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q2** Perform a basic EDA on the aluminum data *without visualization*. Use your analysis to answer the questions under *observations* below. In addition, add your own *specific* question that you'd like to answer about the data---you'll answer it below in q3.

```{r q2-task}
##
glimpse(df_stang_long)
unique(df_stang_long$alloy)
unique(df_stang_long$thick)
unique(df_stang_long$E)
unique(df_stang_long$mu)
mean(df_stang_long$E)
sd(df_stang_long$E)
mean(df_stang_long$mu)
sd(df_stang_long$mu)


```

**Observations**:

-   Is there "one true value" for the material properties of Aluminum?
    -   no, all alloys will be different and even within the same alloy there is no way to garentea that you can perfectly reproduce the exact same combination every time
-   How many aluminum alloys are in this dataset? How do you know?
    -   one alloy, al_24st
-   What angles were tested?
    -   0, 45 , 90 deg
-   What thicknesses were tested?
    -   0.022, 0.032, 0.064, and 0.081 inches thick
-   Are there more unique values of E or mu?
    -   there are 19 unique values of mu and only 9 unique values of E
-   Does E vary more with thickness or angle?

## Visualize

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q3** Create a visualization to investigate your question from q2 above. Can you find an answer to your question using the dataset? Would you need additional information to answer your question?

```{r q3-task}
## TASK: Investigate your question from q1 here
df_stang_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = angle, y = E, color = as_factor(thick))) +
  geom_point()

df_stang_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = thick, y = E, color = as_factor(angle))) +
  geom_point()

df_stang_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = angle, y = E, group = as_factor(thick))) +
  geom_boxplot()

df_stang_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = angle, y = E, group = angle, color = thick)) +
  geom_boxplot()

df_stang_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = E, group = thick, color = as_factor(thick))) +
  geom_density()
df_stang_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = E, group = angle, color = as_factor(angle))) +
  geom_density()
  #geom_dotplot(binwidth = 100)
# df_stang_long %>%
#   ggplot(aes(x = thick, y = E, color = angle)) +
#   geom_point()


```

**Observations**:

-   given the graphs I made I don't think I can conclusively say that E varies more with angle or thickness. I am also not sure that I could conclusively say that it varied with ether in any way.
-   it is also possible that the outlire is making it harder to see.

### **q4** Consider the following statement:

"A material's property (or material property) is an intensive property of some material, i.e. a physical property that does not depend on the amount of the material."[2]

Note that the "amount of material" would vary with the thickness of a tested plate. Does the following graph support or contradict the claim that "elasticity `E` is an intensive material property." Why or why not? Is this evidence *conclusive* one way or another? Why or why not?

```{r q4-vis}
## NOTE: No need to change; run this chunk
df_stang_long %>%

  ggplot(aes(mu, E, color = as_factor(thick))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Observations**:

-   Does this graph support or contradict the claim above?
    -   The evidence is not conclusive. The 0.081 in thick outlire makes it very hard to read the rest of the data presented on the graph.
    -   There appears to be some clumping by thickness in the blob of non outlire values but it is not possible to tell if that is true or an artifact of the graph at this scale.
    -   to move forward I would try to find out why the outlire exists and if it can be discarded I would make a graph that can better show the other values.
