*Purpose*: Most datasets have at least a few variables. Part of our task
in analyzing a dataset is to understand trends as they vary across these
different variables. Unless we’re careful and thorough, we can easily
miss these patterns. In this challenge you’ll analyze a dataset with a
small number of categorical variables and try to find differences among
the groups.

*Reading*: (Optional) [Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category    | Needs Improvement                                                                                                | Satisfactory                                                                                                               |

## Due Date

<!-- ------------------------- -->

All the deliverables stated in the rubrics above are due **at midnight**
before the day of the class discussion of the challenge. See the
[Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qeP6DUS8Djq_A0HMllMqsSqX3a9dbcx1/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110386251748498665069&rtpof=true&sd=true)
for more information.

*Background*: The RMS Titanic sank on its maiden voyage in 1912; about
67% of its passengers died.

# First Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q1** Perform a glimpse of `df_titanic`. What variables are in this dataset?

``` r
## TASK: Perform a `glimpse` of df_titanic
glimpse(df_titanic)
```

    ## Rows: 32
    ## Columns: 5
    ## $ Class    <chr> "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew", "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew", "1s…
    ## $ Sex      <chr> "Male", "Male", "Male", "Male", "Female", "Female", "Female",…
    ## $ Age      <chr> "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child"…
    ## $ Survived <chr> "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "…
    ## $ n        <dbl> 0, 0, 35, 0, 0, 0, 17, 0, 118, 154, 387, 670, 4, 13, 89, 3, 5…

``` r
df_titanic
```

    ## # A tibble: 32 × 5
    ##    Class Sex    Age   Survived     n
    ##    <chr> <chr>  <chr> <chr>    <dbl>
    ##  1 1st   Male   Child No           0
    ##  2 2nd   Male   Child No           0
    ##  3 3rd   Male   Child No          35
    ##  4 Crew  Male   Child No           0
    ##  5 1st   Female Child No           0
    ##  6 2nd   Female Child No           0
    ##  7 3rd   Female Child No          17
    ##  8 Crew  Female Child No           0
    ##  9 1st   Male   Adult No         118
    ## 10 2nd   Male   Adult No         154
    ## # … with 22 more rows

**Observations**:

- Class : “1st”, “2nd”, “3rd”, “Crew”
- Sex: “Male”, “Female”
- Age: “Child”, “Adult”
- Survived: “No”, “Yes”
- n: number / count

### **q2** Skim the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic, and look for a total count of souls aboard. Compare against the total computed below. Are there any differences? Are those differences large or small? What might account for those differences?

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise. 2224 acording to wiki
df_titanic %>% summarize(total = sum(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   total
    ##   <dbl>
    ## 1  2201

**Observations**:

- Write your observations here
- Are there any differences?
  - The calculated value, 2201, is 23 less than the value found on
    Wikipedia, 2224.
- If yes, what might account for those differences?
  - Some passengers may have bought tickets but not actually gotten on
    the ship
  - they could be missing data for some of the passengers or crew
    members
  - Some people could have been traveling under a sudonym

### **q3** Create a plot showing the count of persons who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class` and `Sex`. Document your observations below.

*Note*: There are many ways to do this.

``` r
## TASK: Visualize counts against `Class` and `Sex`
 
df_titanic %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = Class, y = n, fill = Sex))
```

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
df_titanic %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = Sex, y = n, fill = Class))
```

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-2.png)<!-- -->

``` r
df_titanic %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = Sex, y = n, fill = Class), position = "dodge")
```

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-3.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Slightly more men than women survived
- The class with the most survivors was the crew followed by first. I
  wonder if this would still be true if I looked at the percent of each
  group that survived?
- The largest group of male survivors were crew and the largest group of
  female survivors were first class, I assume this is partially due to
  there being significantly less female crew members.
- Second class has the smallest number of survivors. This was surprising
  to me I assumed third would have the smallest number.
- Among women the count of second and third class survivors is
  relatively similar. among men significantly less second class
  passengers survived than third.
- I want to make a graph of the proportions of each group that survived
  I think that would help me understand what happened better.

# Deeper Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Raw counts give us a sense of totals, but they are not as useful for
understanding differences between groups. This is because the
differences we see in counts could be due to either the relative size of
the group OR differences in outcomes for those groups. To make
comparisons between groups, we should also consider *proportions*.\[1\]

The following code computes proportions within each `Class, Sex, Age`
group.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_prop <-
  df_titanic %>%
  group_by(Class, Sex, Age) %>%
  mutate(
    Total = sum(n),
    Prop = n / Total
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
df_prop
```

    ## # A tibble: 32 × 7
    ##    Class Sex    Age   Survived     n Total    Prop
    ##    <chr> <chr>  <chr> <chr>    <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>
    ##  1 1st   Male   Child No           0     5   0    
    ##  2 2nd   Male   Child No           0    11   0    
    ##  3 3rd   Male   Child No          35    48   0.729
    ##  4 Crew  Male   Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  5 1st   Female Child No           0     1   0    
    ##  6 2nd   Female Child No           0    13   0    
    ##  7 3rd   Female Child No          17    31   0.548
    ##  8 Crew  Female Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  9 1st   Male   Adult No         118   175   0.674
    ## 10 2nd   Male   Adult No         154   168   0.917
    ## # … with 22 more rows

### **q4** Replicate your visual from q3, but display `Prop` in place of `n`. Document your observations, and note any new/different observations you make in comparison with q3. Is there anything *fishy* in your plot?

``` r
df_prop %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = Sex, y = Prop, fill = Class))
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`position_stack()`).

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-task-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
df_prop %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = Sex, y = Prop, fill = Class), position = "dodge")
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_col()`).

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-task-2.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Almost all of the first and second class passengers survived
  regardless of sex. This is *fishy* ….
- Most of the third class passengers, slightly less than 50 % F and
  slightly more than 25% M, and male crew members did not survive.
- I was surprised that almost 90% of female crew survived. Possibly they
  mostly worked serving the first and second class passengers and where
  therefore closer to the life boats.
- Is there anything *fishy* going on in your plot?
  - the survival rate for first and second class
  - there are several NAN values bc there were no child crew members

### **q5** Create a plot showing the group-proportion of occupants who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class`, `Sex`, *and* `Age`. Document your observations below.

*Hint*: Don’t forget that you can use `facet_grid` to help consider
additional variables!

``` r
df_prop %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = Sex, y = Prop, fill = Class), position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~ Age)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_col()`).

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Significantly more women survived than men proportionally.
- The higher the class of the woman, excluding crew as mentioned above,
  the more likely they were to survive.
- I am still surprised by the very small proportion of second class men
  who survived.
- Unlike the first and second class, most of the children in third class
  died.
- There were no children on the crew.
- If you saw something *fishy* in q4 above, use your new plot to explain
  the fishy-ness.
  - All of the children in first and second class survived this made the
    other graph confusing

# Notes

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

\[1\] This is basically the same idea as [Dimensional
Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis); computing
proportions is akin to non-dimensionalizing a quantity.
